## MongoDB Secret Update Scenario

- The secret is fetched from vault via external secret
- To simulate password update; first update the mongodb password via terminal
```
mongo admin --username root --password CURRENT_PASSWORD
db = db.getSiblingDB('admin')
db.changeUserPassword("root", "NEW_PASSWORD")
```
- Then go to vault and update the password
- External secret will fetch the new secret
- And then reloader will restart the application
